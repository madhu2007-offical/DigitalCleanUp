# DigitalCleanUp â€“ Save Storage, Save Planet 

## Project Name & Tagline
**DigitalCleanUp** â€“ AI-powered app to clean local and cloud storage, save space, and reduce COâ‚‚ emissions.

## Problem & Solution
We clean our homes regularly, but rarely clean our phones, laptops, or cloud storage. Old files, duplicate photos, unused apps, and spam emails waste storage and energy in data centers, producing COâ‚‚.  

**Solution:** DigitalCleanUp scans local and cloud storage to detect junk files, duplicates, spam emails, and unused apps. It provides a **Digital Waste Score**, COâ‚‚ footprint, and one-click cleanup to free storage and reduce environmental impact.

## Features
- Local storage cleanup (prototype working)
- Duplicate file detection
- Junk file detection
- Digital Waste Score & COâ‚‚ footprint estimation
- Gamification: earn **Green Points ðŸŒ±**
- Future: Cloud storage integration (Google Drive, Gmail, Dropbox, OneDrive)

## How to Run the Prototype
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/madhu2007-offical/DigitalCleanUp.git
