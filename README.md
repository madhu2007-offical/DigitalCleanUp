# DigitalCleanUp
AI-powered app to clean local &amp; cloud storage and reduce digital waste
## Problem
We clean our homes regularly, but rarely clean our digital devices. Old files, duplicates, unused apps, and spam emails waste storage and energy in data centers, causing CO₂ emissions.

## Solution
DigitalCleanUp scans local storage and (future) cloud storage to identify digital waste. Users can review suggestions and clean their storage with a **single click**.

## Features
- Local storage cleanup (prototype working)
- Duplicate and similar file detection
- Junk file detection

- Gamified cleanup with Green Points
- Cloud storage integration planned (Google Drive, Gmail, Dropbox, OneDrive)
